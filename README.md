# Automated-EV-Charging-System-in-Parking.
These days charging stations available for electric vehicles are doing good and demand for EVs is at increasing growth. The concept of pay and charge
for EV is really in boost but with that, the average time taken to fully charge an EV is around an hour which is time consuming for a busy human schedule.
To this, we have proposed the idea of automated charging stations in parking area.
The user can register her/his car and other details and state the particular time she/he wants to charge the vehicle. Charging would stop after the stated time is over.
